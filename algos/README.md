### Testing Leetcode solutions
For PHP files
- Most of them can be placed in Leetcode (Link is given in each file) with minor changes.
You may need to put `$this->` before a function call because in leetcode solution is in a class.
- If you have cloned the repo, you can run via command line, simply `php [filename]`  
- Otherwise, you can use any online php runner like [phpfiddle.org](http://phpfiddle.org)
- Other ways to run are listed in [algos/README.md](../algos/README.md)
